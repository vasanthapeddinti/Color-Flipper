## Description
It is a very simple javascript program to flip the background color. 

It has a basic html and css page which shows the two modes : simple and hex. To make it dynamic, we add javascript in the scriot tag. 
When we click `CLICK ME`, the code selects a random color from the 4 colors in simple mode, where as in the hex mode, we generate a
random 6 digit hex number and render the color in background.
